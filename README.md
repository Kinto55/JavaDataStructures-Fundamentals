# JavaDataStructures-Fundamentals
This is a comprehensive collection of Java data structures and algorithms for common programming tasks. This library is ideal for developers looking to improve their skills in data structures and algorithms, or for those who need to implement efficient solutions in their projects.

## Features
Implements core data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees
Provides efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and other common operations
Well-documented code with clear, concise comments
Easy to use and integrate into any Java project
Installation
To use the JavaDataStructures-Fundamentals library in your project, simply include the jar file in your classpath.

## Usage
Using the library is easy. Simply import the relevant data structure or algorithm class, create an instance, and use its methods to perform the desired operations. For example, to sort an array using the QuickSort algorithm, you could do the following:

## Copy code
import com.javadatastructures.algorithms.sorting.QuickSort;

// Create an instance of the QuickSort class
QuickSort quickSort = new QuickSort();

// Initialize an array to sort
int[] arr = {4, 5, 1, 3, 2};

// Sort the array using the sort method
quickSort.sort(arr);
